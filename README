MinVertexCover version 0.01
=======================

NAME:

MinVexCov 


DESCRIPTION:


This is a C++ implementation of the approximated solution to minimum vertex cover problem utilizing the list heuristic with static ordering based on vertex covering number (node degree). This solution has been proven to have O(sqrt(D)/2 + 3/2) approximation ratio for a decreasing node degree [1].



SYNOPSIS:

    #include<vector>
    #include<string>
    #include<MinVertexCover.hpp>

    using namespace vex;

    vector<string> parent {1,1,1,1,a,a,2,1,2,3,b,2,b,b,4,6,3,2,67,67};       //  any type/object is accepted (int, long, char,string...)
    vector<string> child  {2,4,a,t,t,2,8,5,67,6,23,b,34,21,14,15,68,3,11,17}; //  any type/object is accepted (int, long, char,string...)

/* Constructor */
    VexCov<string,int> Vex(parent,child);
    /*OR*/
    VexCov<string,int> Vex;
    VexCov<string,int> Vex.Make(parent,child);

    vector<string> results = Vex.GetMinVexCov();    //  prints: 67,b,1,2,a,6,4,3,
    Vex.GetError();                                 //  prints approximation ratio: 2 
   
/* Explicit destructor */

   Vex.Purge();   






CONSTRUCTION AND RUNTIME COMPLEXITY:

     For a graph G= (V,E) where V is a set of vertices and E a set of edges:

     Runtime:              O(|V|*|V|)
     
     Approximation ratio:  List/OPT <= sqrt(D)/2 + 3/2
         
              Where D is a maximum covering number (node degree).
